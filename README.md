Authlet
=======

Authlet is a browser bookmarklet designed to provide you the authentication code for websites requiring two-step authentication. You'd normally use an app like Google Authenticator to generate the code; Authlet allows you to use a bookmarklet from your browser itself and have the passcode pop up in an alert or be auto-filled into an input box that you've clicked on. For more long-winded information about Authlet and a chance to customize your own, please visit the GitHub [page](http://whaatt.github.io/Authlet/) for Authlet.
