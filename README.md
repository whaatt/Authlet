Authlet

=======

Authlet is a browser bookmarklet designed to provide you the authentication code for a specific website
requiring two-step authentication. You'd normally use an app like Google Authenticator to generate these
codes; Authlet, however, allows you to use a bookmarklet from your browser itself and have the passcode pop
up in an alert or fill an input box that you've clicked on. For more wordy information about Authlet and 
chances to customize your own bookmarks, please visit the GitHub [page](http://whaatt.github.io/Authlet/)
for this project.
