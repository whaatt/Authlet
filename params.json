{"name":"Authlet","tagline":"A Bookmarklet For Two-Step Authentication","body":"### About Authlet\r\n\r\nAuthlet is a browser bookmarklet designed to provide you the authentication code for websites requiring two-step authentication. You'd normally use a mobile app like Google Authenticator to generate the code; Authlet allows you to use a bookmarklet _from your browser itself_ and have the passcode pop up in an alert or be auto-filled into an input box that you've clicked on. Skip a few sections below to customize your own version of Authlet based on the unique authentication key provided by your institution; read the next two sections for some interesting discussion!\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAs a recent admit to one [certain](http://stanford.edu) university, I was quickly faced with the ~~daunting~~ annoying prospect of using the beast that is two-step authentication. To be clear, I don't think it's an entirely unnecessary precaution in the threat-filled internets of today: it's _merely_ an annoyance. But for power users in the computing world, securing your password with the requisite entropy and street smarts is hardly a concern, while the institutions concerned enough to use two-step authentication probably take good care of your identity on their servers. Authlet is for anyone who doesn't want to pull out their phone and pull up an authenticator app just to check their email.\r\n\r\n### Small Risks\r\n\r\nBy its very nature, Authlet attenuates the purpose of two-step authentication by making it easier to gain access to the second step in _two-step_. Please use Authlet with care and always heed the warnings of your institution's security geeks; I'm not responsible for any trouble related to your use of this bookmark. That being said, I think there's comparatively little to worry about for anyone who exercises good judgment with their credentials.\r\n\r\n### Customize\r\n\r\nYou will need your authentication key to use Authlet. This usually comes in the form of a text-based string of letters and numbers that you are instructed to enter into an app like Google Authenticator; many sites like Dropbox refer to this sequence as your _secret key_. If you are instead presented with only a QR code and no option to get a text-based key, simply download the QR code image and use any one of many free QR decoding services available online. Please enter your key in the input box below.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
