{"name":"Authlet","tagline":"A Bookmarklet For Two-Step Authentication","body":"### About Authlet\r\n\r\nAuthlet is a browser bookmarklet designed to provide you the authentication code for websites requiring two-step authentication. You'd normally use a mobile app like Google Authenticator to generate the code; Authlet allows you to use a bookmarklet _from your browser itself_ and have the passcode pop up in an alert or be auto-filled into an input box that you've clicked on. **Skip a few sections below to customize your own version of Authlet** based on the unique authentication key provided by your institution; read the next two sections for some interesting discussion!\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAs a recent admit to one [certain](http://stanford.edu) university, I was quickly faced with the ~~daunting~~ annoying prospect of using the beast that is two-step authentication. To be clear, I don't think it's an entirely unnecessary precaution in the threat-filled internets of today: it's _merely_ an annoyance. But for power users in the computing world, securing your password with the requisite entropy and street smarts is hardly a concern, while the institutions concerned enough to use two-step authentication probably take good care of your identity on their servers. Authlet is for anyone who doesn't want to pull out their phone and pull up an authenticator app to check email.\r\n\r\n### Small Risks\r\n\r\nBy its very nature, Authlet attenuates the purpose of two-step authentication by making it easier to gain access to the second step in _two-step_. Please use Authlet with care and always heed the warnings of your institution's security geeks; I'm not responsible for any trouble related to your use of this bookmark. That being said, I think there's comparatively little to worry about for anyone who exercises good judgment with their credentials.\r\n\r\n### Customize\r\n\r\nYou will need your authentication key to create an Authlet for a particular website. This usually comes in the form of a text-based string of letters and numbers that you are instructed to enter into an app like Google Authenticator; many sites like Dropbox refer to this sequence as your _secret key_. If you are instead presented with only a QR code and no option to get a text-based key, simply download the QR code image and use any one of many free QR decoding services available online. **I strongly suggest that you first install authentication with your phone alongside Authlet.** Please enter your key in the input box below.\r\n\r\nThe link generated by the input box is your personal Authlet! Drag it to your toolbar or right-click it and bookmark it for future use. The next time you navigate to the given login site, simply click on the passcode input box and then your Authlet. If you don't click on the input box, that's also okay; your passcode will pop up as an alert in your browser.\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\n\r\nAuthlet was an afternoon project borne of impatience and I don't intend to work on this significantly. If you have an idea or feature suggestion, please feel free to contribute to the GitHub repository! Likewise, please let me know if you found Authlet useful.","google":"UA-757876-12","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
